# Quill Assistant Engine

The Quill Assistant Engine is a lightweight execution bridge between conversational AI (Quill) and external automation tools like IFTTT, Shortcuts, and APIs. It allows tasks generated by Quill to be logged, tracked, and dispatched to real-world notification or action systems.

## 🌐 Purpose
To serve as the external memory and task execution core for Quill’s extended assistant network — Claude listens, Quill thinks, this runs.

## 📁 Files Overview

- `quill-assistant-engine.js`: Core logic for processing and dispatching tasks
